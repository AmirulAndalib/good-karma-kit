# The data folder

Container state will be automatically stored in this folder, with one subfolder per container (as configured by the `volumes:` sections in the `docker-compose.yml` file).

You must create this folder manually if you downloaded the `docker-compose.yml` file. You can also clone the entire repo in order to not have to make the folder manually.
